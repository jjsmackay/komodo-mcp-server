# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [Unreleased]

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.2] - Quality & Maintenance

### Dependencies

- Updated `komodo_client` to 2.1.1 with latest API improvements
- Updated all other dependencies to their latest versions for security and stability

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.1] - Improved Progress Reporting & Connection Stability

### Improved

- **Real-time operation stages**: Deploy, start, stop and other long-running operations now show exactly what Komodo is doing (e.g. "Pulling Image", "Starting Container") instead of a generic timer — you always know what's happening
- **Better progress bars in terminal tools**: Remote command execution now shows proper progress indicators compatible with all MCP clients
- **Live log streaming to AI client**: During tool execution, server logs are automatically forwarded to the AI assistant — the AI sees what's going on behind the scenes for better troubleshooting
- **SSE streaming enabled by default**: Progress updates, log messages, and operation status are now reliably delivered during tool execution (previously could be silently dropped in JSON response mode)
- **Stable connections behind proxies**: Long-running connections are kept alive with periodic heartbeats — no more random disconnects when using reverse proxies, load balancers, or cloud deployments

### Fixed

- **Docker startup with missing config file**: The server no longer crashes if `MCP_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` points to a file that doesn't exist yet (e.g. Docker volume not mounted). It now starts gracefully with a warning and uses environment variables only
- **Noisy AI client notifications**: Removed unnecessary debug-level notifications that were being forwarded to the AI client, reducing clutter in the conversation

### Security

- Hardened CI/CD pipeline against supply-chain attacks (pinned dependencies, reproducible builds)
- Added automated code scanning for common security patterns (OWASP)
- Improved rate limiting, clickjacking protection, and regex safety in the underlying framework

### Dependencies

- Updated `mcp-server-framework` to v1.0.5

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.0]

### Added

- **Live progress reporting**: Long-running operations (deploy, start, stop, restart, etc.) now report progress updates to the AI client in real time — no more silent waiting
- **Cancellation support**: All lifecycle operations can be cancelled mid-flight — the AI client can abort running deployments, stack operations, or container actions at any time
- **Richer operation results**: Completed operations now include success/failure status, version info, and relevant log output directly in the response — faster diagnosis without separate log queries
- **Stack file dependencies**: Full support for Komodo v2 stack file dependencies with service mappings and cross-stack requires
- **Environment file tracking**: Stack environment files now support the `track` flag for change detection
- **Compose wrapper includes**: New `compose_cmd_wrapper_include` field for selective compose command wrapping

- **Remote command execution**: Run shell commands directly on servers, inside containers, deployments, and stack services — diagnose issues, run maintenance tasks, or check application state without leaving the AI conversation
- **Live output with progress**: Terminal output streams back in real time with progress updates — long-running commands show what's happening instead of going silent
- **API key management**: List, create, and delete API keys for the currently authenticated user — manage access credentials directly through the AI assistant

- **Three authentication methods**: Support for API Key, JWT Token, and Username/Password authentication — choose the method that fits your setup
- **JWT Token support**: Use pre-existing JWT tokens from browser-based logins (OIDC, GitHub, Google OAuth) to authenticate without storing credentials
- **Automatic connection on startup**: When credentials are configured via environment variables or config file, the server connects to Komodo automatically at launch — no manual `komodo_configure` call needed
- **Connection monitoring with auto-reconnect**: Periodic health checks detect connection loss and automatically re-establish the connection with exponential backoff
- **Login method discovery**: The `komodo_configure` tool queries available login methods (local, GitHub, Google, OIDC) from the Komodo server and displays them for informational purposes
- **Auth rejection detection**: Authentication failures (invalid credentials, expired tokens, unknown users) are clearly distinguished from network errors and reported with actionable messages
- **Error extraction utilities**: Komodo API errors are parsed and formatted into human-readable messages with proper error classification

- **Complete configuration reference**: New `config/` directory with a central reference guide and ready-to-use example configs (TOML, YAML, .env) — every setting documented in one place so you can get started without guessing environment variable names
- **Copy-and-customize config templates**: Just copy `example.config.toml` (or YAML/.env) into your project, adjust the values, and you're done — no more searching through docs for the right variable names
- **Streamlined Docker deployment**: New `docker/` directory with a step-by-step guide, ready-to-use `compose.yaml`, and preconfigured `.env` template — get a production-ready container running in minutes with just `docker compose up -d`
- **Node.js / npx setup guide**: New `examples/node/` guide for running the server natively without Docker — covers npx, global install, and platform-specific instructions for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Improved client integration guides**: Overhauled setup guides for Claude Desktop and VS Code / GitHub Copilot with clearer steps and updated example configs
- **Refreshed README**: Cleaner feature overview, streamlined quick start, and better navigation to all documentation and integration guides

- **Modernized DevContainer**: Faster container startup with lighter `postCreateCommand`, correct port forwarding (8000), Prettier and TypeScript SDK preconfigured — just open in VS Code and start coding
- **Improved MCP Registry metadata**: Richer server.json with repository verification, Docker runtime hints, and input placeholders — MCP clients can display better setup guidance and verify package integrity

### Changed

- **komodo_client v2.0.0 Auth API**: Migrated authentication calls to namespaced API (`auth.login()`, `auth.manage()`) — supports `JwtOrTwoFactor` discriminated union response with explicit 2FA rejection
- **Login options**: `getLoginOptions()` now includes `registration_disabled` field from Komodo v2
- **Connection architecture**: Unified connection management — a single `KomodoConnection` class handles client lifecycle, authentication, health monitoring, and reconnect logic
- **Configure tool**: Richer feedback on connection status including Komodo version, health check results, and available login methods
- **Health check tool**: Reports detailed connection state including server version, MCP server version, and clear status indicators
- **Credential configuration**: Support for Docker secrets (`*_FILE` env vars), config file (`[komodo]` section), and direct environment variables with clear priority chain
- **Environment variable naming**: `KOMODO_JWT_TOKEN` (was `KOMODO_JWT_SECRET`) — clearly identifies the value as a token, not a signing key
- **Validation error handling**: Invalid tool inputs (e.g. multiple auth methods) return clean MCP error responses with server-side warning logs instead of unhandled exceptions

### Fixed

- **localStorage crash on startup**: Added temporary polyfill for `localStorage` in Node.js — `mogh_auth_client` (transitive dependency of `komodo_client` v2) calls `localStorage.getItem()` at module load, which crashes in Node.js 22+ where `localStorage` exists but has no methods without `--localstorage-file`

### Removed

- Framework's `ConnectionStateManager` dependency — connection management is now fully self-contained

### Dependencies

- Updated `komodo_client` to v2.0.0
- Updated `mcp-server-framework` to v1.0.3

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.2.2] - Docker Security & Build Optimization

### 🔐 Security

- **Hardened Runtime User**: Use built-in `node` user (UID 1000) with `/sbin/nologin` shell
  - No interactive login possible for the service account
  - Replaces custom `komodo` user for better security alignment with base image
- **Immutable Build Artifacts**: Build files owned by `root:root`, runtime user cannot modify them
  - `node_modules/` and `build/` are read-only for the application
- **Tini Init System**: Added [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) as PID 1 for proper signal handling
  - Ensures graceful shutdown on SIGTERM
  - Prevents zombie processes
- **Signed Git Tags**: Release tags are now cryptographically signed via GitHub API
  - Annotated tags with release notes for better traceability

### ✨ New Features

- **ARM/v6 Support**: Added 32-bit ARMv6 architecture (Raspberry Pi Zero/1)
  - Docker images now available for: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/arm/v6`

### 📦 Improvements

- **Healthcheck: curl → wget**: Replaced `curl` with `wget --spider` for healthchecks
  - `wget` is included in Alpine (BusyBox) - no additional package installation needed
  - `--spider` performs HEAD request only (more efficient)
- **Optimized Docker Build**: Reduced unnecessary steps and improved layer caching
  - Copy only `src/` and `tsconfig*.json` instead of entire context
  - Removed `curl` dependency from production stage
  - Combined multiple `LABEL` statements into one
- **Build Metadata**: Embedded VERSION, BUILD_DATE, and COMMIT_SHA into container
  - Files available at `/app/build/VERSION`, `/app/build/BUILD_DATE`, `/app/build/COMMIT_SHA`
  - OCI labels include version, created date, and revision
- **GHCR Metadata Fix**: Added `DOCKER_METADATA_ANNOTATIONS_LEVELS: manifest,index` to CI
  - Fixes missing description in GitHub Container Registry for multi-arch images
- **Release Workflow Cleanup**: Removed separate attestation images from GHCR
  - Provenance and SBOM are now embedded directly in image manifest
  - Cleaner registry without `sha-*` tagged attestation artifacts

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **CI Annotations**: Multi-arch images now correctly display metadata in GHCR package page
- **OpenSSF Signed-Releases**: Export SLSA attestations as GitHub Release assets
  - Enables OpenSSF Scorecard to verify signed releases
  - Attestations available as `attestations.intoto.jsonl` in each release

### ⬆️ Dependencies

## [1.2.1] - Minojr Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Docker ARM64 Build**: Fixed QEMU emulation failure during ARM64 cross-compilation
  - Moved `npm prune --omit=dev` to builder stage to avoid running npm in production stage under QEMU
  - Production stage now copies pre-pruned `node_modules` from builder instead of running `npm ci`
  - Resolves "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" error on ARM64 builds

- **Version Resolution in Docker**: Fixed server failing to start with "Server version is required" error
  - Version is now baked into `build/VERSION` during Docker build from `package.json`
  - Single Source of Truth: `package.json` → immutable once image is built
  - Fallback chain: `build/VERSION` → `npm_package_version` → `package.json`

### ✨ New Features

- **ARM/v7 Support**: Added 32-bit ARM architecture support (Raspberry Pi 3, older ARM devices)
- Docker images now available for: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`

### 📦 Improvements

- **Dockerfile Optimization**: Improved multi-stage build with better documentation and layer caching
- **Build Performance**: Production stage no longer runs npm operations, reducing build time and complexity
- **Removed VERSION Build-Arg**: Version is now extracted from `package.json` during build, not passed as argument

--------------------------------------------------------------
